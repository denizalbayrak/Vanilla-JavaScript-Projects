🧠 JavaScript Mini Projects – My Learning Journey
This repository contains my own implementations of several @john-smilga's JavaScript basic projects. I'm following his [JavaScript Basic Projects by john-smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects) as a learning path, but I make improvements, updates, or redesigns wherever I see the opportunity to challenge myself or try something new.

💡 Why I’m Doing This
I'm using these projects to:

Strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals

Practice DOM manipulation and event handling

Improve UI/UX with modern styling or structure

Experiment with custom features or layouts

🛠️ What I Changed
While many of these projects are based on the original structure, I’ve:

Updated UI with modern CSS

Rewritten parts of the logic

Fixed bugs or added features

Used best practices where applicable

📁 Projects Included
Each folder contains a separate project, complete with its own index.html, style.css, and script.js. Check individual folders for details.

This repo is part of my frontend learning journey and will grow over time!
