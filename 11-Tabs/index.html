            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Vegas isn’t just a cat—he’s the king of comfort, master of mischief, and the undisputed ruler of the
                living room. Whether he's lounging like royalty, knocking things off shelves with purpose, or giving
                judgmental stares from across the room, he carries himself with flair. Life with Vegas is anything but
                boring.</p>

                            What started as cautious steps and curious sniffs soon turned into full-blown sofa
                            domination. Over time, he’s gone from a playful kitten to a wise, fluffy force of nature who
                            knows exactly where the snacks are hidden.</p>

                        <p>Vegas envisions a world where every nap is sacred, every sunbeam is reserved seating, and
                            every human instinctively knows when it’s treat time. He believes in the power of calm
                            stares, strategic purring, and the occasional chaos to keep life interesting. His dream? A
                            home (and world) ruled by comfort, curiosity, and catnip.</p>
